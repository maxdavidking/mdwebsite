# Max King's Personal Website

## About
This is a simple site used to showcase my front end dev skills

## Setup
Install gatsby-cli (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start)

### Versions that I know work

## Run tests
There are no tests since this is a static site built with Gatsby

## Run site locally
cd king-site && gatsby develop

## Special Notes/ToDos
Add SVG and animate on load
Add comment to anyone that inspects under head to allow anyone to repurpose
Move king-site directory up a level to root repo directory when finished.
Remove old site code or keep around for posterity?
Remove gatsby README
Remove gatsby defaults in metatags
Use github actions to deploy site to host

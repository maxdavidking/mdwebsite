# Max King's Personal Website

## About
This is a simple site used to showcase my front end dev skills

## Setup
Install gatsby-cli (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start)

### Versions that I know work

## Run tests
There are no tests since this is a static site built with Gatsby

## Run site locally
cd king-site && gatsby develop

## Special Notes/ToDos
Move king-site directory up a level to root repo directory when finished.
Remove old site code or keep around for posterity?
Remove gatsby README

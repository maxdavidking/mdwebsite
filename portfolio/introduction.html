My design journey started recently, doing web design for Illinois Tech's library website redesign. Working with CSS and SASS I adopted
the standard Illinois Tech Drupal theme and repurposed it for the new library website. This was a fascinating process as a lot of paramaters
were already set by Illinois Tech's central office, which made my life both a lot easier and a lot harder. On top of that, Drupal's layout and building 
blocks added another layer of constraints. Often, I found my decisions were a reaction to the existing Illinois Tech Drupal theme, which made for an interesting experience.

My second experience with web design came while making this personal website for Karl Stolley's Fundamentals of Web Development course. With much more 
freedom during this second project I was originally unsure of how to begin. I took a step back, and began looking at a lot of single page websites that I found on
<a href="www.onepagelove.com">One Page Love.</a> Drawing inspiration from those amazing web designers I ended up with what you see here, and on my home page at <a href="maxdavidking.com">
maxdavidking.com.</a>
</p>
<p>
Now I'm interested in diving a bit deeper into the concepts of design that fuel much of web design. I'm curious to see what standards and limits I can
break, play with and follow strictly in design and typography. One of the most important lessons I've learned so far is that standards are a good thing - they 
establish familiarity for users & readers, and upon occasion transgressing them can be a dangerous, fun and artistic game. As an example, for this project I've done
away with the table of contents. It doesn't make sense within the context of a website, and instead I'll be slowly adding to the navbar on the left. Overall - I'm really
excited for the full run of this course.

<h2>Exercise 13: Diagram</h2>

<p>
The data upload I ended up with wasn't what I had initially conceptualized, and I was actually a bit disappointed by that fact. I started by just tracking various elements (font, alignment, the type of photography or design software used) in a spreadsheet. Looking at that data, I thought it would be need to present it as a spreadsheet, but in a way that is much more graphical than statistical. I started by mocking up how that would look on a few pieces of paper, and the idea I settled on I really liked. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to effectively execute that idea in InDesign. After trying to present a more fluid graphic, I gave up and made a literal graphical representation of a spreadsheet, which I'm not entirely pleased with.

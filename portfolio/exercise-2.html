<h2>Exercise 2: Word</h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<p>
The two words I chose were addition and subtraction. I was drawn to the fact that the words were opposites of each other, and the fact that they are mathematical tools as well as words in the English language. Originally, my idea was to splice the two words with a string of symbols that mean addition or subtraction (so a +, ++, AND, while true, etc…) for addition by drawing predominantly from syntax in programming languages. When I started to think about how to put all these together (along with Return, exit, -, NOT for subtraction) my design started to feel really cluttered, so I scrapped that idea and tried to simplify. 
What I ended up with for my design with these words was choosing the font Baskerville, as it’s a more fluid, calligraphic font and I wanted to play against the words mathematical meaning. At the same time, with the content of my design I highlighted the words’ explicit meaning by gradually adding letters to the word addition, and subtracting letters from the word subtraction. Working on this theme I went a step further and reduced the size of the sub in subtraction and increased the size of the add in addition. I was pleased with how well the two designs juxtaposed against each other. Combining the two together makes a very odd musical scale where the length and size of the words rise and fall. It was also interesting to me to see how the font’s size and the length of the words engages or disengages the eye of the reader (me).

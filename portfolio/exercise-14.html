<h2>Exercise 14: Rules and Randomness</h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<p>
This is a collection of my design work throughout the semester for the course, COM528, Document Design. One of the things I try to aspire to in my digital design is a sense of minimalism. To the best of my ability, I want to make a user's experience as clean and uncluttered as possible, while still giving them all the information and options they'll need in order to successfully navigate my design. This approach is still the same in theory, but is executed much differently after having taken this course. Minimalism isn't necessarily an absence of design (which it often was for me before taking this class,) but can also be many design rules done well and simply. This has become my approach: To consciously consider many aspects of design and execute them simply and effectively. 
</p>
<p>
There are a few aspects of design being used in my portfolio page. I've taken a grid / mosaic approach to break down the different components (design exercises) of my website. This provides a nice structure for the meat of my website, parceling out and making it easier to navigate. I've also inverted the hierarchy of my main page, having the elements of my portfolio jump out from ground by giving them a larger font and brighter color than the small bit of text I kept on the main page for the few people who may be visiting this website through serendipitous discovery. Thirdly, when users jump to the meat of the website, the design exercises, I wanted the images and designs I'd created to jump out so I scaled them quite large, while still keeping them below any related text and the title of exercise. Finally, the symmetry of the grid of design exercises is always offset by the menu on the left, which lends attention to the menu while still allowing me to keep the menu quite small.
</p>
<p>
Moving into the future I'd like to do a few things. I want to re-read and re-listen to the two textbooks for this course and to the Design Guy podcast. For the textbooks, I found them a bit too dense and I think a second reading, especially after having done these exercises, rather than before, will be helpful. The Design Guy podcast was just so easily consumable (I could blast through two or three episodes on the train or bus) and provided a lot of valuable content. While I'm going back through these resources, I'd like to start doing a weekly (or maybe bi-weekly) project. My idea is that I would pick something that could take fifteen minutes or a few hours and work on it, trying to apply the design principles I've learned above. What's always so interesting about these classes is that you learn about these things in isolation to real world application. I was excited to create a portfolio as I went, because that was something tangible to work towards, but I don't ever think I'll be applying design principles to an extensively hand-coded HTML and SASS/CSS webpage. More likely, I'll be working on a project and need to snap together some solid design as the project is developed, in a framework that only allows me certain freedoms (Bootstrap, etc...) I'd like to try and get to that 'real world' feeling as much as possible with these mini projects.

<h2>Exercise 8: Color</h2>

<p>
As someone new to design this was a really fascinating week. Using the same design I could really conjure up four different pictures, sometimes with even fairly small changes. It's fascinating the different reactions colors evoke. I played heavily with tint in my two bottom images. The effect was quite light, cool images that seemed peaceful and distant. My top two images I didn't touch the tint, but still managed to get two completely different images by changing the hue and value of my images. In my top right image I found that putting a strong hue with very little tint or shade was quite jarring. I think at this point we're all quite used to seeing flat colors on the web, which are much more pleasing to look at. On my top left image I wanted it to seem as if the sun was rising, which I did so by changing the hue and adding shade to my repeated image as it moved upward on the canvas. This was a really fascinating week.

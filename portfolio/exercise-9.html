<h2>Exercise 9: Figure/Ground Relationship</h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<p>
All of the work here was done in InDesign (god what a great tool) and represents how color contrasts can work for or against a designer's purpose. I actually had a lot of trouble with this exercise as I wanted to do something 'more' than just bars of color, but every time I attempted to do so my attempts took away from the focus of this figure and ground relationship. So bars it is. The stable figure was quite easy - I could have put any two contrasting colors and it would have been pretty obvious which is figure and which ground. I found the reversible image the hardest to complete. I really wanted something that could flip in your mind, and so I ended up having an all green background and reducing the opacity on both the green and the yellow so that they bleed into each other a bit more.

	I'm Max. My cover page is on the left of the page through that "About Me" link, or you can get to to it <a href="maxdavidking.com">here.</a>
	I dropped the idea of a table of contents, since this is, well, a website and not a book. What I'm going to do is add links on the left in the navbar that will scroll you down to different sections of the
	page as my webpage gets longer so you don't have to scroll through this content each week.

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p class="paragraph">
My design journey started recently, doing web design for Illinois Tech's library website redesign. Working with CSS and SASS I adopted
the standard Illinois Tech Drupal theme and repurposed it for the new library website. This was a fascinating process as a lot of paramaters
were already set by Illinois Tech's central office, which made my life both a lot easier and a lot harder. On top of that, the constraints
that Drupal sets in it's layout and building blocks added another layer of constraints. Often, I found my decisions were a reaction to the
existing Illinois Tech Drupal theme, which made for an interesting experience.

My second experience with web design came while making this personal website for Karl Stolley's Fundamentals of Web Development course. With much more 
freedom during this second project I was originally unsure of how to begin. I took a step back, and began looking at a lot of single page websites that I found on
<a href="www.onepagelove.com">One Page Love. </a> Drawing inspiration from those amazing web designers I ended up with what you see here, and on my home page at <a href="maxdavidking.com">
maxdavidking.com.</a>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
Now I'm interested in diving a bit deeper into the concepts of design that fuel much of web design. I'm curious to see what standards and limits I can
break, play with and follow strictly in design and typography. One of the most important lessons I've learned so far is that standards are a good thing - they 
establish familiarity for users & readers, and upon occasion transgressing them can be a dangerous, fun and artistic game. As an example, for this project I've done
away with the table of contents. It doesn't make sense within the context of a website, and instead I'll be slowly adding to the navbar on the left. Overall - I'm really
excited for the full run of this course.

<h2> Design Exercise 1 </h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<figure aria-labelledby="Garamond" class="img2">

    </figure>

    It was incredibly difficult to try and match my hand drawn letters to the printed letters. In particular, I found it difficult to dip below the Baseline with the lower case a. But any parts of the letters that weren’t directly touching the x-height, baseline or cap height were hard to discern the proper scale, length or width. Connecting between the baseline and x-height were particularly difficult, and mistakes built upon mistakes to make my letter appear much sloppier than I would have liked. 
		What I found fascinating was that when I write normally, I write from the top of the letter downwards. Whether that’s normal or a peculiarity to my writing style I don’t know, but for following the letter as closely as possible in this exercise I found it much easier to build from the baseline up. Beginning with any straight line I could hold on to during the beginning also made my drawings come out better, as it formed an anchor around which I could trace the rest of my letter. Without that anchor I often ended up with wildly distorted letters who’s scale was completely wrong. Because of these factors I actually found the last lower case a the most difficult letter by far.

<h2> Design Exercise 2 </h2>

<div class="row1">

The two words I chose were addition and subtraction. I was drawn to the fact that the words were opposites of each other, and the fact that they are mathematical tools as well as words in the English language. Originally, my idea was to splice the two words with a string of symbols that mean addition or subtraction (so a +, ++, AND, while true, etc…) for addition by drawing predominantly from syntax in programming languages. When I started to think about how to put all these together (along with Return, exit, -, NOT for subtraction) my design started to feel really cluttered, so I scrapped that idea and tried to simplify. 
What I ended up with for my design with these words was choosing the font Baskerville, as it’s a more fluid, calligraphic font and I wanted to play against the words mathematical meaning. At the same time, with the content of my design I highlighted the words’ explicit meaning by gradually adding letters to the word addition, and subtracting letters from the word subtraction. Working on this theme I went a step further and reduced the size of the sub in subtraction and increased the size of the add in addition. I was pleased with how well the two designs juxtaposed against each other. Combining the two together makes a very odd musical scale where the length and size of the words rise and fall. It was also interesting to me to see how the font’s size and the length of the words engages or disengages the eye of the reader (me).

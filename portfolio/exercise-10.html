<h2>Exercise 10: Hierarchy</h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<p>
I sketched out a bunch of different ways that I could shape the content of my portfolio book, and it was really interesting how I kept coming back to the hierarchy that pretty much exists on my web page as it is now; nav bar on the left, intro, body and figures in the middle and delineated by small cues. I wanted to try a few ways to really mess with that, one that's only a bit different and actually worked somewhat decently to convey what each element is and the second where I tried something very different from what I would consider "normal" hierarchy and cueing. With so many different elements to play with (colour, text style/size, positioning, alignment) there is a lot of room for variation. As a quick aside, I actually found it incredibly helpful to just sit and sketch out a bunch of ideas on paper before representing them in InDesign. I found colour and positioning to be the most important strategies for determining hierarchy. However, subtle cues with type style like adding an underline to something that is a link, or setting headers and other information in small caps made a very large difference in conjunction with other hierarchical changes.

<h2>Exercise 1: Draw These Letterforms</h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<p>
It was incredibly difficult to try and match my hand drawn letters to the printed letters. In particular, I found it difficult to dip below the Baseline with the lower case a. But any parts of the letters that weren’t directly touching the x-height, baseline or cap height were hard to discern the proper scale, length or width. Connecting between the baseline and x-height were particularly difficult, and mistakes built upon mistakes to make my letter appear much sloppier than I would have liked. 
What I found fascinating was that when I write normally, I write from the top of the letter downwards. Whether that’s normal or a peculiarity to my writing style I don’t know, but for following the letter as closely as possible in this exercise I found it much easier to build from the baseline up. Beginning with any straight line I could hold on to during the beginning also made my drawings come out better, as it formed an anchor around which I could trace the rest of my letter. Without that anchor I often ended up with wildly distorted letters who’s scale was completely wrong. Because of these factors I actually found the last lower case a the most difficult letter by far.

<h2>Exercise 3: Text</h2>
</div>
<div class="row1">
<p>
My approach for this exercise happened after a few sketches/iterations on my design. Originally I wanted to take the format of the newspaper in Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type, and after sketching that out in a few different ways (so that it wasn't just plagiarism) I realized what I was trying to do was format text into a medium that has a highly restrictive formatting structure. This reminded me of my experience with web design, and how there is a general consensus that the header is on top, you have several nav elements below the header, there may be a sidebar on the right and your main content in the middle/left, and a footer at the bottom. So I wanted to see if I could reproduce that, and add typographic twists to emphasize the meaning of each section (capitalization for the title, etc....) The way I ended up accomplishing this was using multiple text boxes within MS Word, essentially in the same way that I would use divs in web design. Having text side by side (the sidebar and the main content) was almost impossible without separating the two chunks of text into two different objects (overlapping text boxes.) I made sure to keep all of my text boxes within the main 6x6 text box, and I ended up with something I was quite pleased with.
